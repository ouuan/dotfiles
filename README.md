# ouuan's dotfiles

These are only a small part of my dotfiles, which are carefully selected to make sure that they are safe to be publicly visible. What's more, they are provided as is, without warranty of any kind. So there may be confusions, missing dependencies, etc.

I use `yadm` and `yadm -Y ... --yadm-repo ...` to manage two versions, the private version and the public version of my dotfiles.
